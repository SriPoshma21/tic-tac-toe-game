 Emoji Tic Tac Toe (Blink Edition)
Emoji Tic Tac Toe is a fun and interactive two-player React game with a twist:
Instead of just Xs and Os, players choose from emoji categories and play using emojis. But there's a catch — you can only have 3 emojis on the board at a time, and your oldest emoji vanishes when you place a fourth one. This "blink" mechanic adds a dynamic twist to classic Tic Tac Toe gameplay!

🚀 Features
🧠 Two-player mode with alternating turns.

🎭 Custom emoji categories for each player.

🧊 Only 3 emojis allowed per player at a time (vanishing emoji logic).

❌ Cannot reuse a spot where your emoji just vanished.

🏆 Real-time win detection (vertical, horizontal, diagonal).

🧩 Easy-to-use interface and smooth animations.

📱 Fully responsive for desktop and mobile.

📘 Help modal with instructions.

Vanishing logic Implementation:

In this version of Tic Tac Toe, each player can only have 3 emojis on the board at any time. When a player attempts to place a fourth emoji, their oldest emoji disappears from the board. This mechanic adds a strategic twist, requiring players to think ahead like in chess or Connect Four.
